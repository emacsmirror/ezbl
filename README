Ezbl - Emacs interface for Uzbl (uzbl.org)

This package creates an Emacs interface for Uzbl, allowing you to control Uzbl
from within Emacs.

It requires Uzbl (www.uzbl.org), as well as a patched version of Emacs which
supports embedding xwidgets, available at
http://github.com/jave/emacs/tree/xembed

Installation
------------

Move the file "ezbl.el" to somewhere in your load-path, and move the script
"handler.py" to the same directory as ezbl.el. You can also set the variable
`ezbl-handler-path' to the path of the "handler.py" file, though it defaults to
looking for a file called "handler.py" in the same directory as "ezbl.el".

Add "(require 'ezbl)" to your .emacs file, and run "ezbl-open" to launch a Uzbl
instance.

Development
-----------

As of version 0.2, the "master" branch on http://github.com/dhax/ezbl should be
considered stable. Updates to that branch should not break existing
functionality, and experimental features will be developed in other branches and
merged to "master" once they are acceptably stable.

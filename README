Ezbl - Emacs interface for Uzbl (uzbl.org)

This package creates an Emacs interface for Uzbl, allowing you to control Uzbl
from within Emacs.

It requires Uzbl (www.uzbl.org), as well as a patched version of Emacs which
supports embedding xwidgets, available at
http://github.com/jave/emacs/tree/xembed

Installation
------------

Move the file "ezbl.el" to somewhere in your load-path, and move the script
"handler.py" to the same directory as ezbl.el. You can also set the variable
`ezbl-handler-path' to the path of the "handler.py" file, though it defaults to
looking for a file called "handler.py" in the same directory as "ezbl.el".

Add "(require 'ezbl)" to your .emacs file, and run "ezbl-open" to launch a Uzbl
instance.

Ezbl - Emacs interface for Uzbl (uzbl.org)

This package creates an Emacs interface for Uzbl, allowing you to control Uzbl
from within Emacs.

It requires Uzbl (www.uzbl.org), as well as a patched version of Emacs which
supports embedding xwidgets, available at http://github.com/jave/emacs/tree/xembed
